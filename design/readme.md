# Design Doc: Weather

The idea is to build a custom version of [Weather Radials](http://www.weather-radials.com/). The envisaged flow is that the user searches for the desired city/location. Then the app will go and gather weather data from an external API and eventually render them as an SVG. The user can then download the resulting SVG.
